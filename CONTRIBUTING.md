# Contributing to GHGIT CLI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). 

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. We may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Running Tests

This project uses [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for testing. To run the test suite, follow these steps:

1. Install Bats on your machine. If you're on a Mac, you can use Homebrew: `brew install bats-core`
2. Navigate to the project root in your terminal.
3. Run `bats ghg_test.bats` to run the test suite.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/jasonnathan/ghg/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jasonnathan/ghg/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) Code of Conduct. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.
